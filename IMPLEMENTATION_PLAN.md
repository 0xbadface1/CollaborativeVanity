# Collaborative Vanity Address Mining — Implementation Plan (v3)

## Context

Building the first implementation of the collaborative vanity address mining system described in the "Capturing and Distributing Cryptographic Luck" paper (Section 4). Smart contracts on Base (Ethereum L2) for collaborative vanity address mining with on-chain share registration and fair token distribution.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Solidity 0.8.28** with `via_ir` (IR-based compilation for better stack depth handling)
- **Foundry** (forge/cast/anvil) — development, testing, local deployment
- **OpenZeppelin v5.6** — ERC-721 (NFTs), ERC-20 (tokens), Checkpoints (cumulative score binary search)
- **Python** (`/simulations`) — Monte Carlo simulations, adversarial scenarios (future)
- **Base** (chainid 8453) — target deployment chain (deferred to later phase)

All code thoroughly documented — the codebase doubles as a Foundry learning resource.

## Terminology

**Players**, not miners. Throughout all code, comments, and documentation.

## Key Design Principles

1. **Shares recorded under SUBMISSION day**, not dayHash day. The dayHash only determines potential currency discovery day.

2. **Currency discoveries don't expire.** Backdating uses an older score snapshot — no unfair advantage since all players' shares are honestly recorded.

3. **NFT tokenIds = addresses**: PlayerNFT tokenId = `uint256(uint160(walletAddress))`, CurrencyNFT tokenId = `uint256(uint160(vanityAddress))`. Lazy minting.

4. **Player score storage uses Checkpoints**: OpenZeppelin's `Trace256` — `(day, cumulativeScore)` with binary search via `upperLookup()`.

5. **Daily pool snapshots**: first submission on a new day triggers a snapshot of pool-wide totals from the previous day. O(1) advancement regardless of gap — skipped days simply have no hash.

6. **Dual accounting**: player credit is capped (1% of pool max), pool total gets full actual work.

7. **Counter + salt separation**: counter is committed in the hash (ordering), salt is the free search variable (iterated rapidly off-chain).

## CREATE2 Architecture

The share hash IS the CREATE2 address computation. Every hash attempt simultaneously produces:
- Leading zeros → share work (proof of work)
- A currency address → optionally vanity, but not judged on-chain

### Formula

```
initCodeHash = keccak256(
    CurrencyToken.creationCode ‖ abi.encode(playerId, dayNumber, targetWork, counter, dayHash)
)

CREATE2 address = keccak256(0xff ‖ MiningPool ‖ salt ‖ initCodeHash)[12:]
```

### Roles of each variable

| Variable | Where | Role | Constraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| `playerId` | initCode | Player identity (= wallet address) | Explicit parameter (third-party submission OK) |
| `dayNumber` | initCode | Time anchor | Must have valid dayHash |
| `targetWork` | initCode | Pre-committed work bet | Anti-Sybil: can't retroactively lower |
| `counter` | initCode | Share submission index | Strictly increasing per player per day |
| `dayHash` | initCode | On-chain daily randomness | Prevents pre-computing shares for future days |
| `salt` | CREATE2 salt | Free search variable | No constraint — iterated billions of times |

The counter defines WHICH address space to search. The salt searches WITHIN that space. Changing the counter changes the initCodeHash, producing an entirely different 2^256-sized search space. The dayHash ensures shares can only be computed after a day's randomness is published.

### Off-chain mining workflow

1. Pick `targetWork`, `dayNumber`, `counter` (must be > last submitted)
2. Look up `dayHash = dayHashes(dayNumber)` — must be non-zero (day must exist)
3. Compute `initCodeHash = getInitCodeHash(me, day, work, counter, dayHash)` — fixed per counter
4. Iterate salt: `hash = keccak256(0xff ‖ pool ‖ salt ‖ initCodeHash)`
5. If `hashToWork(hash) >= targetWork`: submit `(counter, salt)` pair
6. If you want that hash to become a coin: register its address as a currency

The initCodeHash is computed on-chain from `type(CurrencyToken).creationCode` — the token bytecode is baked into MiningPool at compile time. No setter or external loading needed. Any change to CurrencyToken automatically updates all hash computations on recompile.

---

## Contract Architecture

### MiningPool (central contract)

The heart of the system. Deploys PlayerNFT and CurrencyNFT in its constructor. Players interact primarily with this contract.

**Responsibilities:**
- Share submission and validation (`submitShare`)
- Per-player cumulative score checkpoints (day → cumulativeScore)
- Pool-wide score checkpoints
- Daily snapshots — frozen when first submission of next day arrives
- Daily hash publication (O(1), only current day)
- Currency registration (`registerCurrency`) and deployment (`deployCurrency`)
- PlayerNFT lazy minting on first share submission

**Key state:**
- `mapping(playerId => Checkpoints.Trace256)` — per-player cumulative scores
- `Checkpoints.Trace256` — pool-wide cumulative scores
- `mapping(day => DaySnapshot)` — frozen daily pool-wide totals
- `mapping(day => bytes32)` — daily anchor hashes
- `mapping(playerId => mapping(day => uint256))` — last submitted counter per player per day
- `uint256 totalIntegratedWork` — running pool total (uncapped)
- `uint256 totalShareCount` — running share count
- `PlayerNFT playerNFT` — deployed by constructor
- `CurrencyNFT currencyNFT` — deployed by constructor

**Key functions:**
- `submitShare(player, targetWork, dayNumber, counter, salt)` — core share submission (anyone can submit on behalf of a player)
- `registerCurrency(player, counter, salt, dayNumber, targetWork)` → mints CurrencyNFT to current PlayerNFT owner
- `deployCurrency(vanityAddress, totalSupply)` → CREATE2 deploys CurrencyToken, only by NFT owner
- `getPlayerScoreAt(playerId, day)` → checkpoint binary search
- `getPoolScoreAt(day)` → pool-wide checkpoint binary search
- `getInitCodeHash(player, day, work, counter, dayHash)` → for off-chain mining
- `computeVanityAddress(player, counter, salt, day, work, dayHash)` → verify before registering
- `getCurrentDayHash()` → publish current day's hash without submitting a share (resolves dayHash bootstrap)

### CurrencyToken (ERC-20)

Deployed via CREATE2 at registered currency addresses.

**Constructor params** (affect the CREATE2 address):
- `playerId`, `dayNumber`, `targetWork`, `counter`, `dayHash`

**NOT in constructor** (chosen at deployment time):
- `totalSupply` — passed to `MiningPool.deployCurrency()` and stored by `initializeDistribution()`

**Key properties:**
- `miningPool` = msg.sender during CREATE2 (= MiningPool address)
- Only MiningPool can call `initializeDistribution(totalSupply)`
- Players claim through `claim(playerId)`; tokens mint to the current PlayerNFT owner
- Distribution uses `snapshotDay = dayNumber > 0 ? dayNumber - 1 : 0`
- Supply split: 1% discoverer bonus + 99% proportional by score at snapshot day
- Hardcoded name/symbol for now ("Vanity Currency" / "VANITY")

### CurrencyNFT (ERC-721)

Registered currency addresses as tradeable NFTs.

**TokenId** = `uint256(uint160(vanityAddress))`

**Stored per discovery:**
- `counter` — share index (in initCode)
- `salt` — CREATE2 salt (found off-chain)
- `playerId` — registering player
- `dayNumber` — day committed into the CREATE2 address (score snapshot anchor)
- `targetWork` — work target
- `deployed` — whether CurrencyToken has been deployed

**Lifecycle:**
1. Player chooses a hash result as a currency address → calls `MiningPool.registerCurrency()` → NFT minted
2. NFT holder calls `MiningPool.deployCurrency(vanityAddress, totalSupply)` → CurrencyToken deployed at that address
3. NFT becomes souvenir / proof of provenance

Transferable — selling the NFT transfers deployment rights. PlayerNFT ownership controls claim recipients for historical player score rights.

### PlayerNFT (ERC-721)

Player identity as transferable NFT.

**TokenId** = `uint256(uint160(walletAddress))`

Lazy minted by MiningPool on first share submission (idempotent `mintIfNeeded`). Transferable — selling transfers ownership of accumulated mining credits.

### Work Scoring

`MiningPool.hashToWork(hash)` converts a CREATE2 hash into expected work. Lower hashes produce higher work:

```solidity
if (hash == bytes32(0)) return type(uint256).max;
return type(uint256).max / uint256(hash);
```

The all-zero hash saturates to `uint256.max`, which is the largest representable work value.

## Game-Theoretic Design

### Pre-Committed Work (Anti-Sybil)

Target work is baked into initCode (constructor params). Can't retroactively lower.

- **Valid share** (actual >= target): credit = target, capped at 1% of pool total
- **Invalid share** (actual < target): credit = current pool average, capped at 1% of pool total
- **Pool total**: always gets full uncapped actual work

### Dual Accounting

| | Player's Credit | Pool's Total |
|---|---|---|
| Valid share | `min(target, totalWork / 100)` | Full actual work |
| Invalid share | `min(totalWork / totalShareCount, totalWork / 100)` | Full actual work |

Lucky mega-shares boost the pool average for everyone — socialized luck.

### Day Advancement

- Days = `(block.timestamp - dayZeroTimestamp) / 86400`
- Day hash published on first submission of each new day (O(1))
- Skipped days have no hash — shares can't reference them
- Checkpoints bridge gaps automatically (`upperLookup` returns last known value)

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Core System ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Foundry project setup, OpenZeppelin installed
- [x] `CurrencyToken.sol` — minimal ERC-20 with CREATE2 constructor params (incl. dayHash)
- [x] `PlayerNFT.sol` — lazy minting, address-as-tokenId
- [x] `CurrencyNFT.sol` — discovery storage, deployment tracking
- [x] `MiningPool.sol` — share submission, scoring, day management, NFT deployment, currency registration & deployment
- [x] `MiningPool.t.sol` — 44 tests covering submission, ordering, work, credits, days, checkpoints, chain lock, dayHash, getCurrentDayHash
- [x] `NFTIntegration.t.sol` — 25 tests covering PlayerNFT, CurrencyNFT, registration, deployment, third-party registration, full flow
- [x] Third-party submission — `submitShare` and `registerCurrency` accept explicit player address; CurrencyNFT minted to current PlayerNFT owner
- [x] Phase 1 tests passing before Phase 2 additions

### Phase 2: Token Distribution ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Mint logic in CurrencyToken — reads player/pool scores from MiningPool
- [x] 1% discoverer reward + 99% proportional distribution
- [x] Total supply chosen by CurrencyNFT holder at deployment time
- [x] Player claim function (each player calls to receive their share)
- [x] Auto-boost pool on currency deployment — add registered address full-hash work to `totalIntegratedWork` (not `totalShareCount`). Prevents withholding work from the pool. Double-counting with prior share submission is intentional (gift to the commons).
- [x] Integration tests for full mint flow
- [x] `TokenDistribution.t.sol` — 19 tests covering initialization, snapshot timing, claim math, PlayerNFT claim recipients, duplicate claims, zero-score claims, supply cap, auto-boost, multi-player multi-day flow, multiple independent currencies, third-party claiming
- [x] 88 tests total, all passing

### Phase 3: Polish & Edge Cases

- [ ] Bootstrap mechanism for empty pool (pre-seed values, decay, parameters)
- [ ] Day 0/1 edge case handling
- [ ] Minimum share work calibration vs Base gas costs
- [ ] Share expiration (practical concern, TBD)
- [ ] Gas optimization
  - [ ] Use `upperLookupRecent` instead of `upperLookup` in submitShare (2 lookups per call, always recent keys)
  - [ ] creationCode CODECOPY gas (~3-6K per submitShare) — investigate assembly-level optimization
- [ ] Move `getCurrentDayHash()` out of "VIEW FUNCTIONS" section (it modifies state)
- [ ] Add explicit `player == address(0)` revert in submitShare and registerCurrency (currently relies on downstream ERC721 revert with non-descriptive error)
- [ ] Consider `require` instead of `assert` in deployCurrency line 558 (assert consumes all gas on failure)

### Phase 4: BountyEscrow (optional)

- [ ] Locked ETH bounties for specific vanity patterns
- [ ] Claim mechanism with proof

### Phase 5: Simulation & Testing

- [ ] Python Monte Carlo simulations of pool dynamics
- [ ] Adversarial scenario modeling
- [ ] Bootstrap/decay parameter calibration

### Phase 6: Deployment

- [ ] Base testnet deployment scripts
- [ ] Base mainnet deployment

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests per contract** — every function, every edge case
- **Fuzz tests** — Foundry's fuzzer for share verification and future invariants
- **Integration tests** — full flow: submit shares → register currency → deploy → mint
- **Invariant tests** — pool score = sum of player scores, checkpoint ordering
- **Memory-efficient test helpers** — free memory pointer reset in search loops to prevent MemoryOOG
- **Python simulations** — statistical fairness verification (future)

---

## Open Design Questions

1. **Bootstrap mechanism** — pre-seed values, decay schedule, first-share handling
2. **Total supply of currencies** — discoverer-chosen at deployment (not in hash)
3. **Share expiration** — practical concern for stale data, TBD
4. **Minimum share work** — calibrate against Base gas costs (currently 65,536 expected hashes)
5. **Token name/symbol** — hardcoded "Vanity Currency" for now, per-token customization TBD
